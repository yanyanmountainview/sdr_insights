1. When is the best time to call?
2. What's better - quantity or quality? (in the SDR world, some argue that one should take
the time to prepare for each call beforehand, learning about the latest things happening in the company you're calling, the person's hobbies and habits and more. Others swear that just picking up the phone and dialing out more and more numbers is the best strategy)
3. What's the best channel for leads? (i.e. what source of leads, available in the "lead_source" column, has the highest probability of turning into an opportunity?)
4. Any other insights and recommendations you can draw from the data?
